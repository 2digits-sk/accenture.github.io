Accenture contributes to the open source community.
--------
{:class="hdg hdg_1"}
One example of our contributions is that we shared our DevOps platform with the open source community. The DevOps Platform is a container-based development and operations environment which supports rapid mobilization of development projects through a blueprint reference configuration of existing open source Software tools such as Jenkins. Implementation of the tools platform creates an environment to perform Continuous Delivery&mdash;continuously testing, releasing and maintaining applications.

Accenture is also actively engaged with the open source community through our blog page. [Read](/blog) our latest thinking about how open source solutions are integral to today’s digital world.
