Looking to implement Test Automation in project?

_...how about **<span style="color: blue">jump starting</span>** your project's test automation and **avoid typical <span style="color: red">heavy upfront investment</span>** for framework creation._

# Accenture Test Automation Open Source Modular Libraries - ATOM
The ATOM is an accelerator and test harness for building automated tests for browser based applications, mobile applications, and web-services. It consists of loosely coupled java libraries which are based on open source libraries.

## _How does it help?_
The aim is to allow new test projects to re-use these libraries and to focus primarily on developing the test cases and test code. A lot of time and effort is often invested in creating a new test automation framework to support test automation; the ATOM removes this and provides a ready to use solution.
<br><br>
The ATOM supports Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and TestNG based testing using a robust set of open source tools and libraries.

## _How does it work?_
As per industry best practice an automation framework should be tool & technology agnostic and which can be implemented and reused in as many as possible applications/platforms. The ATOM provides a common baseline and re-usable architecture and platform to accelerate the development of automation across teams.
<br><br>
The ATOM is a Java based framework and has the inbuilt capability for web/mobile applications as well as service/microservice based applications (REST, SOAP). The ATOM also provides the capability of executing tests in a cloud-based environment (SauceLabs, BrowserStack).
<br><br>
The ATOM is group of multiple loosely coupled test libraries and a project can use all or some of the libraries according to its test automation requirements. The ATOM's libraries can be consumed by either including the ATOM's source code directly in your project, or by create jars from the source code and importing them directly into your project.

## _How and where to use?_

>IF
* Starting a new project with no exiting automation
* Codeless automation is required for API testing
* Automation has to be developed from scratch in an existing project
* Automation has to be developed while up-skilling the team
* Looking to migrate a project's existing automation framework code to a better framework with rich test supporting libraries
* Looking for a free and open-source test automation framework

>THEN
* ATOM could be an answer

<br>

The ATOM's libraries can be used in combination depending on the project's automation scope. 
* API with BDD – Common + API + Cucumber + Reporting*
* API with TestNG – Common + API
* Web/Mobile with BDD – Common + Selenium + Cucumber + Reporting*
* Web/Mobile with TestNG – Common + Selenium

`*Extent or Allure, depending on the choice of project`

```**There are other supporting libraries – Db (Oracle, MySQl, Sybase, Mongo), Jira, Wiremock and Messaging Queue (Rabbit MQ) which can be used with any of combination above.``` 

## _What’s next?_
