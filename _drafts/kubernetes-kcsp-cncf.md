# Helping enterprise become cloud-native with Kubernetes

We are excited to share some big news today, as we are part of the first batch of Linux Foundation partners to become an official [Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/), please refer to the official announcement for more details: [TODO](http://cncf.io)

The KCSP is great milestone for Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Compute Foundation as Kubernetes becomes part of the container fabric in cloud-native architectures. It also guarantees that partners that have achieved KCSP status provide a deep level of Kubernetes expertise to help enterprises in their Kubernetes journey.

# Our Kubernetes Capabilities

## Container Strategy and Architecture

A container strategy defines the long-term overall goal for containerization, integration within the existing IT operating model and application development practices.

A container architecture establishes the principles, patterns, capabilities, components and products that are desirable to have, to support the execution and operation of containerized applications at scale.

## Application Decomposition and Modernization

Decompose monolithic applications into smaller, cloud-native and standalone components implemented as microservices packaged and run as containers on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Container Migration

Driven by business needs for higher speed, flexibility and cost reductions, enterprises are turning to containers to support their journey to cloud as the means to isolate applications from the underlying infrastructure, lower the infrastructure lock-in risk and enhance DevOps processes for legacy applications.

## Container Security

Securely manage the containerized software supply chain, from container signatures and image scanning to real-time vulnerability manage and container-enabled, policy-based container networking.
