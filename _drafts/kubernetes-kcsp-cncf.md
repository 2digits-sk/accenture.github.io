# Helping enterprises become cloud-native with Kubernetes

We are excited to announce that Accenture is one of the founding members of the [Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/) program started by the Cloud Native Compute Foundation in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. Please see the full announcemnet for more details: [http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/mesoscon-europe)

The KCSP program is a major milestone to help enterprises move to a cloud native platform as it provides a strict set of rules and certified experts to guarantee that only experienced partners are part of the program. This creates a trust relationship as enterprises can rely on Accenture bringing in the necessary experience and guide them on their Kubernetes journey to cloud native application platforms and production usage.

As part of our commmitment to the CNCF and Kubernetes, we will continue our work and participation in the open source community and helping enterprises to successfully adopt Kubernetes. We already have experience with implementing Kubernetes in a variety of industries such as Public Services, Automotive Industry, Telecommunication, Energy, and more.

To learn more on the KCSP program or the CNCF itself, visit the corresponding sites at [KCSP](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/) and [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/news/blog/) or join the conversation on [Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). 

# Accenture Kubernetes Capabilities

## Container Strategy and Architecture

A container strategy defines the long-term goals for containerization, the impact on application architectures, integration with IT operating models and application development practices (DevOps).

A container architecture implements the platform aspect of a container strategy, and establishes the principles, patterns, capabilities, components and products that are desirable to have as part of a container platform. It also support the development, execution and operation of containerized applications at scale with Kubernetes.

## Application Decomposition and Modernization

Decompose monolithic applications into smaller, cloud-native and standalone components implemented as microservices packaged and run as containers on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Container Migration

Driven by business needs for higher speed, flexibility and cost reductions, enterprises are turning to containers to support their journey to cloud as the means to isolate applications from the underlying infrastructure, lower the infrastructure lock-in risk and enhance DevOps processes for legacy applications.

Container migration provides a structured and industrialized approach to efficiently migrate applications to Kubernetes in a cost-efficient manner.

## Container Security

Securely manage the containerized software supply chain, from container signatures and image scanning to real-time vulnerability manage and container-enabled, policy-based container networking.
